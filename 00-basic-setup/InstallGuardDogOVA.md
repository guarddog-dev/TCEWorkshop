# Install and Configure the Guard Dog OVA

## Install the OVA

## Clone the Exercise Repository

Once you've installed the OVA and started the VM, log in to the VM with either SSH or a VM console.
Then clone the exercise repository so you will have local access to the configuration and exercise files:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jeffgbutler/TCEWorkshop.git
```
