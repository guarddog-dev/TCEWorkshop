# Tanzu Community Edition Overview

## Kubernetes vs. A Kubernetes Based Platform

One common misconception about Kubernetes is that it is a complete platform for modern cloud based applications
- it is not. Rather, Kubernetes provides a tremendous starting point for building platforms that make
sense in differnet contexts. For example, you might see the following types of Kubernetes platforms:

1. A platform focused on developer experience that provides automation and runtime support for rapid and
   iterative application development
1. A platform focused on production runtimes that provides a very secure, reliable, and observable
   environment for production workloads
1. A platform focused on management of other platforms with multi-cluster control planes deployed and
   visible to platform operators

It is very common for platform operators to build different types of clusters to meet these different requirements.

## What is Tanzu Community Edition?

Tanzu Community Edition (TCE) is a collection of open source components that lets you build different types
of Kubernetes clusters to meet the different needs of users. It includes an open source Kubernetes
distribution but, more importantly, it includes many other components that are packaged for easy installation.

TCE includes the open source building blocks that are the foundation of VMware's commercial offerings.
